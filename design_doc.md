- File_System_Design_Document

• Design document
A design document is required from each group by Tuesday 4/24, where you sketch an outline of how your program is going to work. 
I want to see detailed explanations of your file system design in each of these areas:


– Physical structure of your file system: FAT or inodes?
– Virtual structure of your file system: full VFS or just a library? If not full VFS, where does the rest of the stuff go? Please describe in detail the steps your OS will perform when an open call is made, for example.
– The file table - data structure to keep track of open files
– Free-space management
– Block-access within a file
– Directory file structures
– superblock and FAT entry/inode layout (as actual structs)
