Design:
  52 inodes in the inode region. The data region begins at block offset 12. Each block size is 512 bytes.
  f_mount() an empty disk generated by ./format

How to log in:
  Two users to choose from: super/basic
  Passwords for them respectively: suser/buser

How to use format to format a disk:
  Run ./format <diskname>
  For example, ./format DISK is going to give an empty disk named DISK.

ls:
  ls
  ls -F
  ls -l
  -- displaying the file information.
  -- file information content: filesize, uid, gid, ctime, mtime, atime, fileytpe(0 for directory files, and 1 for regular files), permission and inode_index
  
cd:
  cd .
  -- staying at the current working directory. working.
  cd ..
  -- jumping to parent directory. working.
  cd <absolute path>
  cd <relative path>
  cd

pwd:
  pwd

mkdir:
  mkdir <relative path>
  mkdir <absolute path>

rm:
  rm <relative path>
  rm <absolute path>
  rm works on both empty directories and on empty files

rmdir:
  rmdir <relative path>
  rmdir <absolute path>

chmod:
  not implemented

cat:

mount:

unmount:

How to test:
- test ls
- test cd
- test pwd
- test mkdir
- test rm
- test rmdir
- test cat

Known issues and limitations:
- gid and uid are not implemented
- ctime, mtime and atime are not implemented
- permission is not implemented.
- Memory leak
- fseek() unitialized
