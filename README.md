# Names: Sarah Depew and Rose Lin

## Design:
  52 inodes in the inode region. The data region begins at block offset 12. Each block size is 512 bytes.
  Open file table is an array of size 20. So we are limiting the max number of open files and directory files to 20.
  The root directory file always occupies the first entry in the open file table.
  As for the file on the disk, we only allow writing to the end of idblocks.
  As for the directory files on the disk, we only allow 80 directories totally. That is to say that the directory files can only be written to the end of dblocks.
  When we open a directory, we only keep the root directory and the parent directory open and put them into open file table.
  f_mount() an empty disk generated by ./format

## How to log in:
  Two users to choose from: super/basic
  Passwords for them respectively: suser/buser

## How to use format to format a disk:
  Run ./format <diskname> to get an empty disk.
  - For example, "./format DISK" is going to give an empty disk named DISK.
  Run ./formatdir <diskname>
  - For example, "./formatdir DISK" is going to give a disk with directory "/user/test.txt" named DISK

### ls:
  ls
  ls -F
  ls -l
  -- displaying the file information.
  -- file information content: filesize, uid, gid, ctime, mtime, atime, fileytpe(0 for directory files, and 1 for regular files), permission and inode_index

### cd:
  cd .
  -- Stays at the current working directory.
  cd ..
  -- Jumps to parent directory and changes the current working directory at the same time.
  cd <absolute path>
  -- Jumps to the right places and changes the current working directory at the same time.
  cd <relative path>
  -- Jumps to the right places and changes the current working directory at the same time.
  cd
  -- Jumps to the root directory and changes the current working directory at the same time.

### pwd:
  pwd

### mkdir:
  mkdir <relative path>
  -- mkdir <filename>
  -- mkdir ./<filename>
  -- mkdir ../<filename>
  mkdir <absolute path>
  -- Creates the directory at the right place.

### rm:
  rm <relative path>
  rm <absolute path>
  rm works on both empty directories and on empty files

### rmdir:
  rmdir <relative path>
  rmdir <absolute path>

### chmod:
  not implemented

### cat:

### mount:

### unmount:

## How to test:
#### shell function:
- test ls
- test cd
- test pwd
- test mkdir
- test rm
- test rmdir
- test cat
#### file system functions:
- test f_read
- test f_write
- test f_mount
- test f_unmount

## Known issues and limitations:
- gid and uid are not implemented
- ctime, mtime and atime are not implemented
- permission is not implemented.
- Memory leak
- fseek() unitialized
- We can only mount our disk at the root directory, and mounting multiple disks at different directory is not implemented.
- Writing to i2 and i3 blocks of a file are not handled.
